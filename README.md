# Creating Spring boot custom starter

If you have a lengthy configuration repeating across multiple applications, create a custom spring boot starter and include in those applications. The starter brings you required Maven dependencies as well as some predefined configuration bits.

* greeter-library: The sample library that we're creating the starter for.
* greeter-spring-boot-autoconfigure: The project containing the auto-configuration for the library.
* greeter-spring-boot-starter: The custom starter for the library.
* greeter-spring-boot-sample-app: The sample project that uses the custom starter.
